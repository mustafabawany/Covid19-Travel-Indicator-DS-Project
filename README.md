# Covid19-Travell-Inidicator-DS-Project

# INTRODUCTION
The system that will be designed will enable the travelers around the globe to be able to take guide from the system and get to know about the countries that are safe to travel with respect to purposes (business, vacations). This system is unique in a sense that it will be the first that will directly help the travelers around the globe.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s world when the world is being surrounded by the fear of Covid 19 and there are people who want to go out for their respective purposes wants to know about the countries that are available as per their choice and purpose. Many people are struggling to find the right place according to the trends and statistics available and are unable to interpret and find the required destination.

# SALIENT FEATURES
1. Covid 19 Statistics: Cases and Deaths (by Country) , Testing and Ratio
2. Travel Guideline Basis of Country: Deep learning algorithms to indicate travel guidelines.
3. Purpose Based Indicator: If travelling necessary, indicator will propose the reasons for travel.
4. Covid-19 Checker: Check through symptoms whether a person have covid19.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
Programming Language: C++.
IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Dev C++.
Compiler: MinGW for C++.

# SYSTEM AND DEEP LEARNING
The system we will be designing is directly linked to a deep learning process. System fetch the datasets available for the Covid 19 across the globe and upon the basis of main algorithms of deep Learning that are:
i) Naïve Bayes Algorithm.
ii) Decision Trees.
